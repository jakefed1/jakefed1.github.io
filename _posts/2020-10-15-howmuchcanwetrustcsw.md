In 2018, [PitcherList](https://www.pitcherlist.com) writers Nick Pollack and Alex Fast began citing a new stat called CSW (Called strikes + whiffs) in their analysis of individual pitching performances on their podcast. After the season concluded, Fast decided to dig deeper, and explore whether the metric had predictive power on a larger scale.

## An Introduction to Baseball Data

The awesome thing about professional baseball data is that in most cases, we don’t have to take samples, we can analyze the entire population because it actually is available. MLB has advanced radar and camera based player tracking systems including but not limited to [Statcast](http://m.mlb.com/glossary/statcast), Hawkeye, TrackMan, and PitchFX that track the exact position of the ball and each player at every instant, allowing for the creation of thousands of metrics that I don’t have time to explain, and more importantly, a greater understanding of baseball. While the raw statcast data isn’t released to the public, MLB publishes hundreds of statistics that their own data scientists create with the data on [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com) Additionally, websites like [Baseball Prospectus](https://www.baseballprospectus.com), [Fangraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com), [Retrosheet](https://www.retrosheet.org), and [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com) house dozens of stats that are formulated based on event outcomes as opposed to tracking data. CSW would fall under this category, as it doesn’t rely on, say, the position of the ball as it’s released from the pitcher’s hand, rather the outcome of each pitch as a called strike, whiff, or anything else.

As someone involved with the baseball analytics community, I have worked with both statcast tracking data and outcome-based stats from Fangraphs. For example, in my article [JT Realmuto is a Different Breed](https://medium.com/@jake_federman/j-t-realmuto-is-a-different-breed-d025956ead48), I utilized tracking data to analyze catcher defense, particularly one specific catcher, JT Realmuto, who I noticed was significantly better than his competition. In [MLB Free Agency Through Analytics](https://medium.com/@jake_federman/mlb-free-agency-through-analytics-663b5da3d86), I used statistics from Fangraphs to discuss the top MLB free agents of the 2019 class.

## Fast's Findings

Fast’s finding was that CSW had more predictive power then a lot of the stats considered to be in the top tier of metrics by analysts. He created scatterplots to assess CSW’s descriptiveness and predictiveness relative to other top statistics. Fast assigned weights to his data and fudged it around a little, but most of the changes are detailed extensively in the article. For example, he states, “Per the advice of Travis Peterson, a senior data scientist at Major League Baseball, the pitches in all of the following models are weighted. In other words, pitchers like Max Scherzer are going to be weighted a bit more than Edwin Diaz.” (This makes sense, as Scherzer is a starting pitcher who throws around 100 pitches per outing, while Diaz is a reliever who rarely throws more than 30.)

## How Much Confidence Can We Have in Fast's Findings?

Pardon the repitition of the word confident, but I feel very confident saying I have complete confidence in Fast’s findings. First of all, as I previously mentioned, Fast details most of the small changes he and his team made to the dataset in their research, and all of them are very logical. Second, and most importantly, Fast made it clear that this metric was made by the community, for the community. It wasn’t constructed behind closed doors, it was built in the public eye, with suggestions coming through Twitter from widely respected analysts inside and outside of MLB (as an organization). Additionally, Fast isn’t hiding leaderboards that show each pitcher’s CSW, he’s releasing them to the public. Avid fantasy baseball players like myself can add the stat to their toolkit of go-to metrics for trades, acquisitions, and other roster decisions. Even if Fast wasn’t releasing his leaderboards, because all of the data is publicly available on Baseball Savant and Fangraphs, replicating the metric wouldn’t be particularly difficult. The fact that people like Ariel Cohen are already finding ways to [build metrics that are based on CSW](https://fantasy.fangraphs.com/wpdi-csw-strikeout-rate/) even though CSW was just introduced to us last year shows just how easy it is to reproduce.

I’d like to extend my trust in Fast’s article to nearly all studies produced by the sports analytics community. In the broader sports analytics community, ensuring that one’s research is reproducible is critical. That’s why analysts and journalists will often share their code, or even their raw data, on websites like Github ([Here's my Github profile, with code from four of my projects](https://github.com/jakefed1)). Additionally, a lot of people that conduct sports analytics based research do it not because their income depends on it, but solely because they enjoy it. Voros McCracken was an amateur statistician with no ties to anybody of significance in the realm of baseball when he published what would end up being [one of the foundational pieces of today’s baseball analytics](https://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/article/878/pitching-and-defense-how-much-control-do-hurlers-have/). Finally, sports data tends to be more reliable then datasets in other industries for a variety of reasons. First of all, the sophistication of the player tracking systems utilized by professional sports leagues blows away the technologies and sampling methods used by any other industry, allowing for both more data and better data. Second, as mentioned earlier, in a lot of cases, we don’t actually have to take samples because the entire population tends to be available. Third, very little of sports data is based on judgement, rather measurements or outcomes. There’s no sport in which all three of these conditions are more true than baseball.

## The Potential Role (or lack thereof) of "Publish or Perish" Culture

Publish or perish definitely did not affect Alex Fast’s CSW study, even though it is unlikely that the article would’ve been published if the metric didn’t hold much predictive power. Fast is currently employed by both MLBAM and PitcherList, and he publishes regular articles and hosts a podcast for the latter organization. His income isn’t dependent on whether he puts out a single research project. Fast’s fantastic work earned him the 2019 Fantasy Sports Writers Association Research Article of the Year award.
